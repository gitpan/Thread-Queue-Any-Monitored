=head1 VERSION

This documentation describes version 1.01.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

                    *** A note of CAUTION ***

 This module only functions if threading has been enabled when building
 Perl, or if the "forks" module has been installed on an unthreaded Perl.

                    *************************

A queue, as implemented by C<Thread::Queue::Any::Monitored> is a thread-safe 
data structure that inherits from C<Thread::Queue::Any>.  But unlike the
standard C<Thread::Queue::Any>, it starts a single thread that monitors the
contents of the queue by taking new sets of values off the queue as they
become available.

It can be used for simply logging actions that are placed on the queue. Or
only output warnings if a certain value is encountered.  Or whatever.

The action performed in the thread, is determined by a name or reference
to a subroutine.  This subroutine is called for every set of values obtained
from the queue.

Any number of threads can safely add sets of values to the end of the list.

=head1 CLASS METHODS

=head2 new

 ( $queue, $thread )= Thread::Queue::Any::Monitored->new( {
   pre     => \&pre,
   monitor => 'monitor',
   post    => \&module::post,
   queue   => $queue, # use existing queue, create new if not specified
   exit    => 'exit', # default to undef
 } );

The C<new> function creates a monitoring function on an existing or on an new
(empty) queue.  It returns the instantiated Thread::Queue::Any::Monitored
object in scalar context: in that case, the monitoring thread will be
detached and will continue until the exit value is passed on to the queue.
In list context, the thread object is also returned, which can be used to wait
for the thread to be really finished using the C<join()> method.

The first input parameter is a reference to a hash that should at least
contain the "monitor" key with a subroutine reference.

The other input parameters are optional.  If specified, they are passed to the
the "pre" routine which is executed once when the monitoring is started.

The following field B<must> be specified in the hash reference:

=over 2

=item do

 monitor => 'monitor_the_queue',           # assume caller's namespace

or:

 monitor => 'Package::monitor_the_queue',

or:

 monitor => \&SomeOther::monitor_the_queue,

or:

 monitor => sub { print "anonymous sub monitoring the queue\n" },

The "monitor" field specifies the subroutine to be executed for each set of
values that is removed from the queue.  It must be specified as either the
name of a subroutine or as a reference to a (anonymous) subroutine.

The specified subroutine should expect the following parameters to be passed:

 1..N  set of values obtained from the queue

What the subroutine does with the values, is entirely up to the developer.

=back

The following fields are B<optional> in the hash reference:

=over 2

=item pre

 pre => 'prepare_monitoring',              # assume caller's namespace

or:

 pre => 'Package::prepare_monitoring',

or:

 pre => \&SomeOther::prepare_monitoring,

or:

 pre => sub { print "anonymous sub preparing the monitoring\n" },

The "pre" field specifies the subroutine to be executed once when the
monitoring of the queue is started.  It must be specified as either the
name of a subroutine or as a reference to a (anonymous) subroutine.

The specified subroutine should expect the following parameters to be passed:

 1..N  any extra parameters that were passed with the call to L<new>.

=item post

 post => 'stop_monitoring',                # assume caller's namespace

or:

 post => 'Package::stop_monitoring',

or:

 post => \&SomeOther::stop_monitoring,

or:

 post => sub { print "anonymous sub when stopping the monitoring\n" },

The "post" field specifies the subroutine to be executed once when the
monitoring of the queue is stopped.  It must be specified as either the
name of a subroutine or as a reference to a (anonymous) subroutine.

The specified subroutine should expect the following parameters to be passed:

 1..N  any parameters that were passed with the call to L<new>.

Any values returned by the "post" routine, can be obtained with the C<join>
method on the thread object.

=item queue

 queue => $queue,  # create new one if not specified

The "queue" field specifies the Thread::Queue::Any object that should be
monitored.  A new L<Thread::Queue::Any> object will be created if it is not
specified.

=item exit

 exit => 'exit',   # default to undef

The "exit" field specifies the value that will cause the monitoring thread
to seize monitoring.  The "undef" value will be assumed if it is not specified.
This value should be L<enqueue>d to have the monitoring thread stop.

=back

=head2 self

 $queue= Thread::Queue::Any::Monitored->self; # only within "pre" and "do"

The class method "self" returns the object for which this thread is
monitoring.  It is available within the "pre" and "do" subroutine only.

=head1 OBJECT METHODS

=head2 enqueue

 $queue->enqueue( $scalar, [], {} );
 $queue->enqueue('exit'); # stop monitoring

The C<enqueue> method adds all specified parameters as a set on to the end
of the queue.  The queue will grow as needed to accommodate the list.  If the
"exit" value is passed, then the monitoring thread will shut itself down.

=head1 USING ANOTHER SERIALIZER

Please see the section C<USING ANOTHER SERIALIZER> in L<Thread::Queue::Any>
for a description of the options for using specific data serializers.

=head1 REQUIRED MODULES

 Test::More (0.88)
 Thread::Queue::Any (1.11)
 Thread::Queue::Monitored (1.02)

=head1 INSTALLATION

This distribution contains two versions of the code: one maintenance version
for versions of perl < 5.014 (known as 'maint'), and the version currently in
development (known as 'blead').  The standard build for your perl version is:

 perl Makefile.PL
 make
 make test
 make install

This will try to test and install the "blead" version of the code.  If the
Perl version does not support the "blead" version, then the running of the
Makefile.PL will *fail*.  In such a case, one can force the installing of
the "maint" version of the code by doing:

 perl Makefile.PL maint

Alternately, if you want automatic selection behavior, you can set the
AUTO_SELECT_MAINT_OR_BLEAD environment variable to a true value.  On Unix-like
systems like so:

 AUTO_SELECT_MAINT_OR_BLEAD=1 perl Makefile.PL

If your perl does not support the "blead" version of the code, then it will
automatically install the "maint" version of the code.

=head1 CAVEATS

You cannot remove any values from the queue, as that is done by the monitoring
thread.  Therefore, the methods "dequeue", "dequeue_dontwait" and
"dequeue_keep" are disabled on this object.

Passing unshared values between threads is accomplished by serializing the
specified values using C<Storable> when enqueuing and de-serializing the queued
value on dequeuing.  This allows for great flexibility at the expense of more
CPU usage.  It also limits what can be passed, as e.g. code references can
B<not> be serialized and therefore not be passed.

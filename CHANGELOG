	Added class method "self" for use within the "pre" or "monitor"
	routine the Thread::Queue::Any::Monitored object they're working for.

	Changed the input parameters of "new" to be more like those of
	Thread::Pool->new.  This is incompatible with the way it was
	before.  Fortunately there won't be that many people hurt by
	it.  Adapted the test-suite accordingly.

	First version of Thread::Queue::Any::Monitored.

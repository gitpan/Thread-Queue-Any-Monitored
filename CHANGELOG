	Some code refactoring and code esthetics.  Verified it runs on 5.14.2.

0.08    3 October 2007
        Hopefully fixed test-suite for non-thread enabled Perls.  Updated
        to use new VERSION feature of Devel::Required.

	28 January 2004
	Made sure the test-suite cleans up on multi-versioned systems.

0.07	28 December 2003
	Added automatic required modules update using Devel::Required.

0.06	13 August 2003
	Cleaned up Makefile.PL and updated copyright info.  Made sure the
	test-suite runs ok with warnings enabled.

	Removed our and ":unique" attribute as with all of my other Thread::xxx
	modules.

0.05	24 July 2002
	Made $VERSION and @ISA have the : unique attribute to save memory.

	Fixed some documentation nits.

	23 July 2002
	Fixed problem with warnings if an undefined exit value was used
	(the default).

0.04	21 July 2002
	Added "can_ok" test to test-suite.

	Renamed dummy "dequeue_nb" to "dequeue_dontwait" to be more in line
	with Thread::Pool.  Added synonym "dequeue_nb" for compatibility.

0.03	18 July 2002
	Added support for "post" routine, so that a routine will be executed
	when monitoring stops.  Results of the "post" routine are available
	with the "join" method on the thread object.

0.02	17 July 2002
	Added class method "self" for use within the "pre" or "monitor"
	routine the Thread::Queue::Any::Monitored object they're working for.

	Changed the input parameters of "new" to be more like those of
	Thread::Pool->new.  This is incompatible with the way it was
	before.  Fortunately there won't be that many people hurt by
	it.  Adapted the test-suite accordingly.

0.01	17 July 2002
	First version of Thread::Queue::Any::Monitored.
